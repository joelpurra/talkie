One reason is that some voices are built for the newer WinRT speech system, and some for the older Speech Application Programming Interface (SAPI). Browsers may not support both the old and the new speech systems, meaning that a voice which is in fact installed, may still not be available in your favorite browser. Over time, most browers will probably support the newer WinRT system. If you are missing voices in your language, one suggestion is to try using Talkie in Microsoft Edge."

The challenge started with the question: while commuting to work, is it possible to listen to an article instead of reading it? Easy, I said, and set out to prove it — or at least to make my browser speak out text using a silly computer voice. The basic edition, without any user interface, turned out to be trivial to create. Adding a user interface, took a bit longer. Adding proper language detection a bunch more code. Overcoming bugs in the browser even more work.
