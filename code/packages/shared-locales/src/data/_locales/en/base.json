Your favorite browser may not support both the old and the new speech systems, meaning that a voice which is in fact installed may not be usable.

In 2021, as a consequence of the policy change, Google deleted both Talkie and Talkie Premium from CWS because they were considered duplicate \"spam\". The separate web extensions Talkie and Talkie Premium had to be refactored to become a single web extension. Google announced Manifest Version 3 (MV3) in 2018, and began pushing developers to upgrade in 2020 despite MV3 not yet being complete. Throughout 2020-2024 Google continuously threatened to delete or demote Talkie for not being MV3-compatible. During this time Talkie's upgrade to MV3 had several false starts, cancelled due to incomplete MV3 features and compatibility differences between Chrome and Firefox. In 2024 the time came to upgrade Talkie to MV3 — an effort which took several weeks due to long-standing browser bugs and MV3-differences between Chrome and Firefox. For these reasons, working on the hobby project that is Talkie has to a large extent turned joyless. Let's see what happens when the next mandatory policy change comes.",

    "message": "Talkie was developed a few days before the New Year 2016/2017, on a challenge from a friend. The challenge started with the question: while commuting to work, is it possible to listen to an article instead of reading it? Easy, I said, and set out to prove it — or at least to make my browser speak out text using a silly computer voice. The basic edition, without any user interface, turned out to be trivial to create. Adding a user interface, took a bit longer. Adding proper language detection a bunch more code. Overcoming bugs in the browser even more work. The list of improvements and features goes on — and a few thousand lines of code later, you're looking at the end result."
